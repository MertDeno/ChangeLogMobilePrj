/**
 * The `Icon` component represents an SVG icon. There are two main scenarios how the `Icon` component is used: as a purely decorative element; or as a visually appealing clickable area in the form of an icon button.
 *
 * A large set of built-in icons is available and they can be used by setting the `name` property on the `Icon`. But before using an icon, you need to import the desired icon.
 * For the standard icon collection, you have to import an icon from the `@ui5/webcomponents-icons` package:
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/employee.js";`
 * For the SAP Fiori Tools icon collection (supported since 1.0.0-rc.10), you have to import an icon from the `@ui5/webcomponents-icons-tnt` package:
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-icons-tnt/dist/antenna.js";`
