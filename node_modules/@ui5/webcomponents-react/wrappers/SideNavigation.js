 * The `SideNavigation` is used as a standard menu in applications. It consists of three containers: header (top-aligned), main navigation section (top-aligned) and the secondary section (bottom-aligned).
 *
 * *   The header is meant for displaying user related information - profile data, avatar, etc.
 * *   The main navigation section is related to the userâ€™s current work context
 * *   The secondary section is mostly used to link additional information that may be of interest (legal information, developer communities, external help, contact information and so on).
